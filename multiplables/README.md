# Multiplables: Multiplication Tables Drills

Requires boost library, SFML library, and cmake.  What a mess for the
poor user trying to build this!  Sorry.

Maybe this will work:

* Install your favorite SFML library
* Install your favorite boost library
* Edit CMakeLists.txt to update the include directories
* Edit CMakeLists.txt to update the library directories
* Run `cmake .` (Note the space and dot after cmake.)
* Run `make`
